# What do I have to do?
# - Find a matching from Expenses accounts to corresponding Budget accounts.
# - Look at every Expenses account.
# - Find all transactions that don't have a budget entry and whose date is on or
#   after the start date.
# - For each such transaction.
# - Find the expense entries.
# - Generate an entry for Budgeted Funds and the corresponding budget account.
# - Add them to the transaction. ← Only non-functional step.

# TODO: Make sure that we're adding transactions in the right currency.

# Matched Splits are expense Splits for which a budget Split with the same

#
# Basic functionality:
#  - We find unmatched expense Splits and add matching budget Splits. We can
#    only add a matching budget Split if there is a parallel budget account for
#    the expense account of the unmatched Split.
#  - We check if the sum of the amounts of the expense splits matches the sum of
#    the amounts of the budget Splits.
#
# Everything else will catch more errors, but will also not understand manual
# adjustments. For example, if the money for two expense accounts was budgeted
# on a single budget account, I'd have to adjust the transaction manually, but
