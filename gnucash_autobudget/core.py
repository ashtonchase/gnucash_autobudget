# What do I have to do?
# - Find a matching from Expenses accounts to corresponding Budget accounts.
# - Look at every Expenses account.
# - Find all transactions that don't have a budget entry and whose date is on or
#   after the start date.
# - For each such transaction.
# - Find the expense entries.
# - Generate an entry for Budgeted Funds and the corresponding budget account.
# - Add them to the transaction. ‚Üê Only non-functional step.

# TODO: Make sure that we're adding transactions in the right currency.
